Recently I joined a AC/DC tribute band, to pay homage to the legends. Last night was our first gig, I was little bit concerned, cause we didnt have enough practice. But it turned out really well. Great fun !

Kudos to Tokyo Underground legend Andy Mc Kinlay from the [Kinlay Band](http://kinlayband.com/) for making this possible !
