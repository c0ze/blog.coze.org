I moved my blog and personal CV site over to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a> the new cool kid in the static web site generators block. So far, I like it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and fastness. It doesnt have the flexibility of Jekyll, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that will bite me in the long run. In the porting process, to only thing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find is a gallery / carousel plugin, because, unlike Jekyll, hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have plugins, so one of my pages is kinda broken. I will have to come up with a custom gallery solution for it some time (which will involve lots of js I am afraid).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Just created a Ruby Gem</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2017-09-30-emblaze/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2017-09-30-emblaze/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had this old Ruby script lying around which I was using to upload my sites to s3 whenever I
wanted to deploy something new.&lt;/p>
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/c0ze/0bcf901231e19dc4303d.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>However, as you can imagine, copying this script around was not the best solution as in time, I added bits
here and there, updated to use new aws-sdk etc, and keeping them all in sync was getting tedious &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sooo, finally I nudged myself and put it in a gem. Ladies and Gentlemen, here is &lt;a href="https://github.com/c0ze/emblaze">Emblaze&lt;/a> !
It&amp;rsquo;s basically a rake task to minify &amp;amp; gzip &amp;amp; and upload a static site to S3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stellar Battery on Oxygen OS</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2016-03-15-opo-oxygenos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2016-03-15-opo-oxygenos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been getting stability issues with Cyanogen on my OPO lately, so I decided to give OnePlus&amp;rsquo;s native &lt;a href="https://oneplus.net/2/oxygenos">OxygenOS&lt;/a> a whirl.
First I installed the initial version 1.0.0, which was kind of dated. I thought I could make my way into a newer
version via OTA updates, alas, no there is no OTA available for OPO it seems, which is kind of baffling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I flashed the newest version, which was &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/oxygenos-2-1-4-for-the-oneplus-one.425544/">2.1.4&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s still a 5.1.1 Lollypop based build, but it was
much more better polished. And the battery life I get with this ROM is simply amazing :&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang Gotchas</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2016-02-26-golang-gotchas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2016-02-26-golang-gotchas/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with golang lately, and got to know its intricacies better.
At first, I have to admit I was not very enthusiastic playing with it, but the more I got to know about it, the more I warmed to to its concepts.
And I observed it has matured pretty well from version 1.1 when I first started to play with it to version 1.4 and 1.5 when I first got do to something useful using Go.
Here I will summarise my Gotchas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Switching Carriers</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-12-29-switching-carriers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-12-29-switching-carriers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately wifey&amp;rsquo;s cellphone was acting up, so I got her a brand new &lt;a href="https://oneplus.net/x">One Plus X&lt;/a> as a christmas present.
Unfortunately, the SIM that was installed in her &lt;a href="http://www.ymobile.jp/lineup/302hw/">YMobile provided Huawei P7&lt;/a> didn&amp;rsquo;t
like the One Plus X.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what was the problem, but we were not able to enter the Ymobile APN for some reason, and the default APN installed
in the SIM didn&amp;rsquo;t work in One Plus, and YMobile customer service were not able to help. So I decided to jump ship to Docomo
based &lt;a href="https://www.iijmio.jp/hdd/miofone/">IIJmio&lt;/a> which had a great family plan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eddystone vs iBeacon</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-10-30-eddystone-vs-ibeacon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-10-30-eddystone-vs-ibeacon/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are interested in IoT, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of Estimote. They are probably the leading beacon
provider in the IoT field and that&amp;rsquo;s for a good reason. We&amp;rsquo;ve had &lt;a href="http://estimote.com/#jump-to-products">their dev kit&lt;/a> for a while,
and had since been using them happily ever since. Their beacons quality is top notch, software frequently
updated, and customer service usually responsive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of recently, &lt;a href="http://blog.estimote.com/post/124002171455/estimote-brings-full-compatibility-of-new">Estimote annouced support&lt;/a>
for &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/eddystone">Google&amp;rsquo;s Eddystone protocol&lt;/a>, a
beacon broadcast protocol which is a competitor to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/">iBeacon from Apple&lt;/a>. I will admit that
I am a pretty much hopeless Google fanboy, since their products tend to give end users more freedom. But this time, we had a
much better, concrete reason to jump ship from iBeacon to Eddystone, &lt;em>fleet management&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Gitlab CI setup</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-10-03-using-s3-as-a-deb-repository/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-10-03-using-s3-as-a-deb-repository/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re fervent supporters of Gitlab in our company, and &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/22/gitlab-8-0-released/">when they rolled out a new CI module&lt;/a>, we immediately jumped in to see how
we can use it. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve had experience with Jenkins, and a little bit with Travis. The Gitlab CI module is kind of based on Travis which is cool.
It&amp;rsquo;s rather new so I had my doubts about it initially, but fortunately it turned out pretty good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AC Chee Z !</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2013-06-01-ac-chee-z/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2013-06-01-ac-chee-z/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I joined a AC/DC tribute band, to pay homage to the legends.
