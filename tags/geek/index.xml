First I installed the initial version 1.0.0, which was kind of dated. I thought I could make my way into a newer
version via OTA updates, alas, no there is no OTA available for OPO it seems, which is kind of baffling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I flashed the newest version, which was &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/oxygenos-2-1-4-for-the-oneplus-one.425544/">2.1.4&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s still a 5.1.1 Lollypop based build, but it was
much more better polished. And the battery life I get with this ROM is simply amazing :&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Switching Carriers</title><link>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-12-29-switching-carriers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c0ze.github.io/blog.coze.org/blog/2015-12-29-switching-carriers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately wifey&amp;rsquo;s cellphone was acting up, so I got her a brand new &lt;a href="https://oneplus.net/x">One Plus X&lt;/a> as a christmas present.
Unfortunately, the SIM that was installed in her &lt;a href="http://www.ymobile.jp/lineup/302hw/">YMobile provided Huawei P7&lt;/a> didn&amp;rsquo;t
like the One Plus X.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what was the problem, but we were not able to enter the Ymobile APN for some reason, and the default APN installed
in the SIM didn&amp;rsquo;t work in One Plus, and YMobile customer service were not able to help. So I decided to jump ship to Docomo
based &lt;a href="https://www.iijmio.jp/hdd/miofone/">IIJmio&lt;/a> which had a great family plan.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
