      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been getting stability issues with Cyanogen on my OPO lately, so I decided to give OnePlus&amp;rsquo;s native &lt;a href=&#34;https://oneplus.net/2/oxygenos&#34;&gt;OxygenOS&lt;/a&gt; a whirl.
First I installed the initial version 1.0.0, which was kind of dated. I thought I could make my way into a newer
version via OTA updates, alas, no there is no OTA available for OPO it seems, which is kind of baffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I flashed the newest version, which was &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/oxygenos-2-1-4-for-the-oneplus-one.425544/&#34;&gt;2.1.4&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s still a 5.1.1 Lollypop based build, but it was
much more better polished. And the battery life I get with this ROM is simply amazing :&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately wifey&amp;rsquo;s cellphone was acting up, so I got her a brand new &lt;a href=&#34;https://oneplus.net/x&#34;&gt;One Plus X&lt;/a&gt; as a christmas present.
Unfortunately, the SIM that was installed in her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ymobile.jp/lineup/302hw/&#34;&gt;YMobile provided Huawei P7&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t
like the One Plus X.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what was the problem, but we were not able to enter the Ymobile APN for some reason, and the default APN installed
in the SIM didn&amp;rsquo;t work in One Plus, and YMobile customer service were not able to help. So I decided to jump ship to Docomo
based &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iijmio.jp/hdd/miofone/&#34;&gt;IIJmio&lt;/a&gt; which had a great family plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
