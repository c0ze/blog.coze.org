      <description>So it&amp;rsquo;s already 2018, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to say goodbye to Jekyll, and move on to greener pastures. I moved my blog and personal CV site over to Hugo the new cool kid in the static web site generators block. So far, I like it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and fastness. It doesnt have the flexibility of Jekyll, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that will bite me in the long run. In the porting process, to only thing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find is a gallery / carousel plugin, because, unlike Jekyll, hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have plugins, so one of my pages is kinda broken.</description>

      <title>Just created a Ruby Gem</title>

      <description>I had this old Ruby script lying around which I was using to upload my sites to s3 whenever I wanted to deploy something new.
However, as you can imagine, copying this script around was not the best solution as in time, I added bits here and there, updated to use new aws-sdk etc, and keeping them all in sync was getting tedious &amp;hellip;
Sooo, finally I nudged myself and put it in a gem.</description>

      <title>Golang Gotchas</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with golang lately, and got to know its intricacies better. At first, I have to admit I was not very enthusiastic playing with it, but the more I got to know about it, the more I warmed to to its concepts. And I observed it has matured pretty well from version 1.1 when I first started to play with it to version 1.4 and 1.5 when I first got do to something useful using Go.</description>

      <title>Eddystone vs iBeacon</title>

      <description>If you are interested in IoT, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of Estimote. They are probably the leading beacon provider in the IoT field and that&amp;rsquo;s for a good reason. We&amp;rsquo;ve had their dev kit for a while, and had since been using them happily ever since. Their beacons quality is top notch, software frequently updated, and customer service usually responsive.
As of recently, Estimote annouced support for Google&amp;rsquo;s Eddystone protocol, a beacon broadcast protocol which is a competitor to iBeacon from Apple.</description>

      <title>Our Gitlab CI setup</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re fervent supporters of Gitlab in our company, and when they rolled out a new CI module, we immediately jumped in to see how we can use it. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve had experience with Jenkins, and a little bit with Travis. The Gitlab CI module is kind of based on Travis which is cool. It&amp;rsquo;s rather new so I had my doubts about it initially, but fortunately it turned out pretty good.</description>
